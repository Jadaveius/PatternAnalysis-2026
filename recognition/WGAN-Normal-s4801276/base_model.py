# NOTES - For myself to be removed/moved to README
# No fully connected or pooling layers are used

# Generator starts with 100-dimensional latent vector, reshapes into 3D and does convlutions to 64x64
# Discriminator starts at 64x64, does convolutions and then binary logistic regression

# Discriminator is same as generator but opposite

# Use ReLU activation in generator for all layers except output with is Tanh
# Use Leaky ReLu activation in all discriminator layers

# Discriminator is HIGH when x is training data and LOW when x is generated
